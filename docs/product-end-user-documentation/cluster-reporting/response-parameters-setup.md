# Response Parameters setup

In this section \("Response Parameters" in the left hand navigation\) of the interface all the response parameters of this response plan can be viewed. These are the cluster objectives, cluster activities, partner projects and partner activities, along with the indicators that are associated with it.

At the top left one can select which cluster they'd like to view all the data for. There are other filters available on each list view as well.

### Clusters

Cluster objectives and activities are the primary component here. Along with Disaggregations. The IMO can create any of these, partners can view this data.

Disaggregations lets the IMO create in one place, ways in which indicator report data can be disaggregated for the entire response plan.

### Partners

This represents a place where any signed in user can view all partner projects and activities for this response plan.



### Adding a Project for a Partner as an IMO

IMO can add a project for partners \(within their cluster?\) from the response parameter section.

IMO chooses the partner and if the project is existing to be pulled from OCHA or a new custom project. Please see [OCHA integration](ocha-integration/README.md) for more details.

If the IMO pulls a project from OCHA, they will be able to choose from a list of projects pertaining to that partner and see details for that project. This flow / screens / fields etc. \(other than the partner dropdown\) are exactly the same as what the partner would do. Please see [here](planning-your-action-as-a-partner.md) for more details.

IMO can edit project afterwards as well.
