# Planning your action as a Partner

In this section \("My Planned Action" in the left hand navigation\) of the interface is where the partner can view and setup their planned actions to support the work of the cluster. This section is only visible to a partner user who is logged in. A checkmark will indicate whether a project is from OCHA. The IMO does not see this section.

Partners can add custom Projects here or pull from OCHA.
