# Overview

### Core Data Concepts

Below a visual representation of the core data concepts relating to cluster reporting.  A workspace consists of one or more countries. Each workspace then can have one or more response plans. And each response plan will have one or more clusters associated with it.

### Selecting a Response Plan {#selecting-a-response-plan}

In the context of the workspace the user has selected, they will have to always select a response plan, before they can proceed further. This ensures that the entire user interface is functioning and showing data for one response plan at a time only, and keeps reporting / data / setup for response plans not to overlap or interfere with each other.

If the response plan the IMO would like to add is not there, they can add a new response plan or select an existing one from OCHA Response Planning & Monitoring \(RPM\).

For Custom Projects, IMO can fill out Response Plan name, plan type, start date, end date, and select cluster\(s\) involved. They can select many or at least one for this response plan. **TDB get confirmation from Dariusz on this**
